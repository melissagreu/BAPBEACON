  This project contains the least you need to get started with a Beacondo app.
  There are several icon files, all with names beginning with "icon." These get copied
  into your app automatically at build time. They are:

  - iconBack.png: the icon you want to be shown on the back button if you open a web page.
  - iconForward.png: the icon you want to be shown on the forward button if you open a web page.
  - iconPlay.png: the icon you want to be used for the play button for movies in carousels and slideshows.
  - iconRefresh.png: the icon you want to be shown on the refresh button if you open a web page.

  There is also one HTML file, pageTemplate.html. This lets you design a standard header and footer for your
  pages inside the app. Inside this file you'll see some basic HTML and a line that says <!--CONTENT-->. This
  line should be left intact, because it's that line that gets dynamically replaced with your page content.
